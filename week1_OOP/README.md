This week we'll explore this concepts:

**Introduction to OOP concepts:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses objects to represent and manipulate data. It is based on the concepts of classes and objects. OOP is often used to model real-world objects and systems, and it provides a way to organize and manage complex code.  

**Classes, Objects, and Instances:** A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. An object is an instance of a class. Objects have properties, which are represented by variables, and behaviors, which are represented by methods.  

**Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Encapsulation:** Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a new class to be based on an existing class. Polymorphism is the ability of objects to take on many forms. Encapsulation refers to the practice of hiding the internal workings of an object from the outside world and is often used to protect the integrity of the object.  

**Class Methods, Static Methods, and Instance Methods:** Class methods are methods that are bound to the class and not the instance of the class. Static methods are methods that belong to the class and not the instance of the class. Instance methods are methods that operate on an instance of the class.  

**Properties and Decorators:** Properties are a way to define getter and setter methods for object properties. Decorators are a way to modify or enhance the behavior of a function or method. They are often used to add functionality to a class or to provide a way to modify its behavior at runtime.
